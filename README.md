# sdvx-eg-exscore-analyzer
Reads the numbers off of the results screen to get some analytics revolving around EX score.
Absolutely still an early, early WIP

## Requirements (for now until I move away from Jupyter into straight up Python)
### System install
- Python
- Tesseract-OCR 

### pip install
- jupyter notebook
- opencv-python
- pytesseract
- matplotlib

## Usage (for now)
1. Place the **sdvxDigits.traineddata** into the *tessdata* folder found wherever you installed Tesseract-OCR.
<br>Default location is `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata` <-- drag and drop **sdvxDigits.traineddata** into here

2. Open **analyzer.ipynb** in Jupyter and read the instructions in there before running all the cells

## Current iteration of sdvxDigits.traineddata: v1.0
